  \begin{center}
  \parbox{6.762in}{I am a .Net web developer with two and a half years of commercial experience. While it is not my current primiary focus, I spend a considerable amount of time honing my front end development skills, as I wish to eventually become a JavaScript developer. I enjoy tinkering with algorithms and optimsation, achieving optimal runtime for fun and in competitive settings. I tend to write code in my spare time, usually in order to automate mundane and repetitive tasks, as well as acquire an unfair advantage in online games.}

		\item{IEEEXtreme} - Every year the IEEE organizes an international programming competition for students. The event gets teams of 3 to solve programming problems for 24 hours straight with the final score being calculated based on speed and correctness. In 2009 me and my teammates were ranked \textbf{2\textsuperscript{nd}} in the world. In 2010 we were ranked \textbf{15\textsuperscript{th}.}
		\item{ACM} - Similarly to the IEEE, the ACM is organizing localized programming competitions with a similar format, with premade teams of three, given a single computer, and 5 hours to solve as many problems as possible out of a set. Me and my teammeates were awarded the silver medal for the Auckland region in 2007, and the bronze medal in 2008.
