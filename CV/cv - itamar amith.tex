\resheading{Personal Statement}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{center}
  \parbox{6.762in}{I am a software engineer with a strong academic background in algorithmics and mathematics, who is always up for a new challenge. While finding solutions to problems was my main focus for a long time, I am now shifting my focus to finding elegant solutions, with emphasis on design and architecture, not only functionality. I enjoy spending time in front of a whiteboard just as much as time in front of a keyboard. Most of my coding outside of work is done to automate mundane and repetitive tasks, or in order to acquire unfair advantage in online games. }

		\resitem{Designed and implemented a geospatial index, allowing querying for items based on polygon-shaped area constraints, as well as sort by distance from a given point.}
		\resitem{Completely rewrote the existing solution for range indexes, allowing for better performance when filtering search based on a numerical range.}
		\resitem{Co-authored an improved query language to be used by the engine.}
		\resitem{Built a new version of the navigation component from the ground up, which allows constructing complex hierarchical queries in a fully data driven manner.}
		\resitem{Worked with engineers from other teams, on site, off site and overseas to assist with consumption of Ryvuss as well as assistance with general application architecture and design.}
		\resitem{Participated in strict code reviews, as both reviewer and reviewee, at all stages of the software life cycle to ensure optimal outcome.}

\resheading{Achievements}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item Programming Competitions
	\begin{description}
		\item{IEEEXtreme} - Every year the IEEE organizes an international programming competition for students. The event gets teams of 3 to solve programming problems for 24 hours straight with the final score being calculated based on speed and correctness. In 2009 me and my teammates were ranked \textbf{2\textsuperscript{nd}} in the world. In 2010 we were ranked \textbf{15\textsuperscript{th}.}
		\item{ACM} - Similarly to the IEEE, the ACM is organizing localized programming competitions with a similar format, with premade teams of three, given a single computer, and 5 hours to solve as many problems as possible out of a set. Me and my teammates were awarded the silver medal for the Auckland region in 2007, and the bronze medal in 2008.
	\end{description}
\item Academic Achievements
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In 2008 I've presented the contents of my Honours Dissertation's research in the University of Auckland's Science Faculty's poster competition and was awarded a Merit Certificate.
