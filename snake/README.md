JSnake - Early 2011
====

(To be honest I added the "J" in front of snake this very moment, after the project was unmodified for literally years. It made me feel very modern.)

So this one day Stu was complaining about creating a simple Snake game in Java. Eating apples, dodging corners and your own tail, all in a days work for the individuals fortunate enough to take CS105.
Now while the task at hand was not particularly difficult, I decided to lead by example, and spent the following 40 minutes trying to draw a rainbow in mspaint.
The result, is in this folder. It is inefficient, ugly, and embarrassing for everyone, but it entertained me for a while, and now it is here.
